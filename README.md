## Predicting Climatic Trends with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study Using the Jena Climate Database

Exploring the potential of machine learning in climate trend analysis. Utilizing the Jena Climate dataset, the goal is to predict temperature trends using non-temperature-related parameters. To achieve this, we crafted and compared custom implementations of three distinct machine learning models: Random Forest, Naive Bayes algorithm, and LSTM neural networks.

This project was not only about developing predictive models but also about a thorough comparison with existing third-party implementations. Through this hands-on experience, we gained deep insights into model effectiveness, data handling, and the nuances of building machine learning models from scratch.
